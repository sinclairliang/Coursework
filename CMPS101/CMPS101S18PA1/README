As in Java integers can only represent integers from -2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647, we decide to design a method to bigger integers in
Java. In my case, I used integer arrays to store each integers
individually. Later I also developed different arithmetic methods such
as addtion, subtraction, multiplication and division. After I am done
with integers, I extended my apint to aprat, in order to represent
rational numbers.
