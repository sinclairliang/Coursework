Design
-------------------------

This is the same problem we worked on in the last assignment, however
in C this time. As C is not an object oriented language, we can simulate the features of an object oriented language.

Difficulties 
------------------------- 
The first difficulty I ran into is the ways to deal with pointers. With
Java I did not have to deal with pointers, but everything in C is
related somehow with pointers. So I first started with familiaring
with pointers. In every function I was working with I have to think a
step ahead to determine how long the array would be because I used the
array implementation.
