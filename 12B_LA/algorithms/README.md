## A Letter to My Students ##

First of all I would like offer my best congratulations upon completing CS 12B, data structures. I am very honoured being part of your learning journey in this interesting topic. 

I have much emotions for this class. I have taken it it three times: first time I took it with Professor Tantalo in the summer of my freshmen year, the next quarter, exactly one year before this quarter, I was the small group tutor with Professor Sesh, now I took it again, with you!

Data Structures is so far one of my favourite classes in UC Santa Cruz if not Zumba or Aesthetic in Philosophy. It is fun because it involves creativity, we are learning others' design to efficiently store data, process data and manipulate data. 

Every Tuesday and Thursday I was excited to go to school because I knew I had 12B with all of you, to learn such topic once again. Even today I still learn something new when I walk out of that lecture hall. I hope you all had the same excitements when acquiring some new knowledge. 

12B is done, what is next?

Now it is time to move on to algorithms.

Why do we need to learn algorithm if I just want to code?

```
To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, 
and how one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. 
The people who hate algorithms are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.

-- Peter Norvig
```

```
If you want to become a good programmer, 
you can spend 10 years programming, 
or spend 2 years programming and learning algorithms.

-- Erik Demaine
```

Algorithms and Data Structures are the two most important components in computer science either in academia or in the industry. Mostly it means to achieve the maximum performance with limited computational resources. I know memories are cheap, cheap, cheap now. But spending 10 years sorting an array is significantly worse than doing it with 50 seconds. 

Algorithms, from a broader sense, are ways to instruct computers. It involves design, creativity and mathematical elegancy. I wish you the best luck in further study of algorithms.

If you would like to get a head start in the winter break before your CS 101, I would recommend you some resources online. `Introduction to Algorithms` is a classic, full of mathematics, thus not quite friendly to people with little mathematical backgrounds. 

`Algorithms` by `Sedgewick` is much nicer in my opinion. It covers `Sorting`, `Searching` and `Graphs`. 

The importance of outside projects:

It is great if you get an A in this class I am happy for you. However, I have to say the best way to use all the cool stuff you picked up in 12B is by doing projects. Since you have already had a basic understanding of `Java` language, I encourage you looking into `Spring` or `SpringBoot` framework if you are interested in web development; `Hadoop` is you are more into big data related field. In any case, I personally will be more tha happy to guide you to a project if you have no idea where to start looking. 

I did not realise the importance of outside projects until the tail of summer this year, and I don't want my students to be like me. 

Whichever you do, with all my heart, I wish you a very happy winter break.
