## Algorithms for further study ##

First of all I would like offer my best congratulations upon completing CS 12B, data structures. I am very honoured being part of your journey in this interesting topic. Now it is time to move on to algorithms.


Why do we need to learn algorithm if I just want to code?

```
To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.

If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend 2 years programming and learning algorithms.

Algorithms and Data Structures are the two most important components in computer science either in academia or in the industry. Mostly it means to achieve the maximum performance with limited computational resources. I know memories are cheap, cheap, cheap now. But spending 10 years sorting an array is significantly worse than doing it with 50 seconds. 

Algorithms, from a broader sense, are ways to instruct computers. It involves design, creativity and mathematical elegancy. I wish you the best luck in further study of algorithms.
