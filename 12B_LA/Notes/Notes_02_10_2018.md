How to print an array in reverse order by using recursion?

```
int[] A;
void printRev(int[] A, int i, int j)
```

A)
```
{
    if(i==j) return;
    print(A[j]);
    printRev(A, i , j-1);
}
```
B)
```
{
    print(A[j]);
    if(i==j) return;
    printRev(A, i , j-1);
}
```
C)
```
{
    if(i==j) return;
    printRev(A, i , j-1);
    print(A[j]);
}
```

Q: which is the correct algorithm to do so?

A: only B! If we take 
```
A = [1]
```
which has length of 1, only B will give us something.

==> We can test our codes in small examples.


Base Case is very important, it directly impacts if your recursion will crash or work

Exercise 1: Recursively print all the subarrays of an array. An array of n elements contains 2^n subarrays.

Exercise 2: Recursively print all the permutations of an array. An array of n elements contains n! permutations.

Exercise 3: Voters in an election, they can vote Yes, No or Dont care on issues. Print all the possible outcomes with n voters. It shoule be 3^n outcomes.
