### abstraction and objects ###

Perhaps you wanna construct your `Queen` class to solve NQueens problem...?

```java
class Queen{
    int col;
    int row;

    public Queen(int c, int r){
        // constructor;
        col = c;
        row = r;
    }

    Boolean isAttacking(Queen q){
        // class method;
        if(col == q.col || row == q.row){
            return True;
        }

        // diagonal comparisons
        else if(...){
            //...
        }
    }
}
````


### Some advantages in using Object ###

1. Encapsulates Data;
2. Enables dynamically assemble data;
3. inner methods
4. etc.

`Example in class`

We want a list of students who are enrolled in this class. How do we want to do that?
