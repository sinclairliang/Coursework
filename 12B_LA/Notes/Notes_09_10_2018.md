### abstraction and objects ###

Perhaps you wanna construct your `Queen` class to solve NQueens problem...?

If you forget to `push` but you did `commit` on `git`, you can still receive credits because `git` records timestamp when you commit it. Unless you really want to cheat by changing some values... But hey if you know how to use it you might just want to `push`. (I should not have mentioned this technique in class)

```java
class Queen{
    int col;
    int row;

    public Queen(int c, int r){
        // constructor;
        col = c;
        row = r;
    }

    Boolean isAttacking(Queen q){
        // class method;
        if(col == q.col || row == q.row){
            return True;
        }

        // diagonal comparisons
        else if(...){
            //...
        }
    }
}
````


### Some advantages in using Object ###

1. Encapsulates Data;
2. Enables dynamically assemble data;
3. inner methods
4. etc.

## Data Structures ##

`Example in class`

```
We want a list of students who are enrolled in this class. How do we want to do that? (We refer students by their ID numbers)
```

```
Specifications:
(1) Insert new students;
(2) Remove Students;
(3) Find students;
```

```
Array approach
```

```java
class StudentList{
    int [] ids;
    int end;
    // constructor;
    // add()
    // remove()
    // find()
}
```

By deploying this approach, some questions emerge:

1. Array is not sizeable, what if we don't yet know the number of students yet?
   
   ==> We can double the size of array and copy each elements when the size limit is hit (expensive operations)

2. Linear search is O(n), not efficient
3. Array takes up a chunk of memory, contiguous one, hard to allocate sometimes.

### LinkedList ###

Wait!!! Let's talk about `objects` and `reference` in memory!!

Basic idea: In `Java`, objects are passed by references, which are just `pointers` in `C/C++`

```java
if(you are not quite familiar with pointers){
    if(you want to wait for professor Sesh){
        wait;
        he will go over next week;
    } else if(you want me to post a video){
        // that is how I learnt btw;
        return (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BpYD7TxvKU);
    } else if(you can come to my MSI sessions){
        return "cool, see you there!";
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```


Cool, now let's dive into `LinkedList`

### Basic Data Structure ###

```java
class Node{
    int val;
    Node next; // look! this is recursive;

    Node(int newval){
        // constructor;
        val = newval;
        next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList{
    Node head;


}
// Initially head = null;

void insert(int newval){
    Node latest = new Node(newval);
    latest.next = head;
    head = latest
}

```
