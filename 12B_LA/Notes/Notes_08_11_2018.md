Today we talk about how to delete a node in a tree.

So basically we have three cases:

1. If the node we want to delete has no child, aka a leaf itself, we simply set its parent's left or right pointer to `null`.
2. If the node we want to delete has only one child, we simply skip it and point its parent's left or right pointer to the chile of the node we wish to delete.
3. Now the tricky case: what if we want to delete a node that has two children?? The way we do it is we first `swap` the value of the largest value on the left subtree or the smallest value on the right subtree with the `to_be_delete` node and delete that leaf. By doing so we shall be able to maintain the Binary Search Tree Properties. 

   

Having Hard time visualise it? Here is a video.

_(Sunset by Porter)_

These days the whole bay area is covered in smoke, be sure to take care of yourselves. Here I would like to share a poem by Borges:

```
   What can I hold you with?
   I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs.
   I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.
   I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honoured in bronze:
      my father's father killed in the frontier of
      Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs,
      bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in
      the hide of a cow; my mother's grandfather
      --just twentyfour-- heading a charge of
      three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on
      vanished horses.
   I offer you whatever insight my books may hold, whatever manliness or humour my life.
   I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.
   I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved,
      somehow --the central heart that deals not
      in words, traffics not with dreams, and is
      untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.
   I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born.
   I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself.
   I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.
```

_- Jorge Luis Borges (1934)_
