### Sorting algorithms ###

In today's lecture we have talked about three sorting algorithms: `selection sort`, `insertion sort` and `merge sort`

`Selection Sort`

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

```
procedure selection sort 
   list  : array of items
   n     : size of list

   for i = 1 to n - 1
   /* set current element as minimum*/
      min = i    
  
      /* check the element to be minimum */

      for j = i+1 to n 
         if list[j] < list[min] then
            min = j;
         end if
      end for

      /* swap the minimum element with the current element*/
      if indexMin != i  then
         swap list[min] and list[i]
      end if
   end for
	
end procedure
```

Runtime for this algorithm:
Since we are traversing the arraying for each smallest element we are finding, for n elements we traverse the array n times. Overall runtime is therefore $O(n^2)$

`Insertion Sort`

Insertion sort sorts elements the exact same way as how we will sort a hand of poker. We simple just pick the element and put it in its right position.

```
procedure insertionSort( A : array of items )
   int holePosition
   int valueToInsert
	
   for i = 1 to length(A) inclusive do:
	
      /* select value to be inserted */
      valueToInsert = A[i]
      holePosition = i
      
      /*locate hole position for the element to be inserted */
		
      while holePosition > 0 and A[holePosition-1] > valueToInsert do:
         A[holePosition] = A[holePosition-1]
         holePosition = holePosition -1
      end while
		
      /* insert the number at hole position */
      A[holePosition] = valueToInsert
      
   end for
	
end procedure
```

The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of $ÎŸ(n^2)$, where n is the number of items.

`Merge Sort`

This is a very powerful sorting algorithm with `divide and conquer` paradigm. This algorithm contains two parts: `dividing` and `merging`. We will readily see the `merging` part is doing all the heavy lifting.

```
void merge_sort (int A[ ] , int start , int end )
{
    if( start < end ) {
    int mid = (start + end ) / 2 ;           // defines the current array in 2 parts .
    merge_sort (A, start , mid ) ;                 // sort the 1st part of array .
    merge_sort (A,mid+1 , end ) ;              // sort the 2nd part of array.

    // merge the both parts by comparing elements of both the parts.
    merge(A,start , mid , end );   
   }                    
}



void merge(int A[ ] , int start, int mid, int end) {
//stores the starting position of both parts in temporary variables.
int p = start ,q = mid+1;

int Arr[end-start+1] , k=0;

for(int i = start ;i <= end ;i++) {
    if(p > mid)      //checks if first part comes to an end or not .
       Arr[ k++ ] = A[ q++] ;

   else if ( q > end)   //checks if second part comes to an end or not
       Arr[ k++ ] = A[ p++ ];

   else if( A[ p ] < A[ q ])     //checks which part has smaller element.
      Arr[ k++ ] = A[ p++ ];

   else
      Arr[ k++ ] = A[ q++];
 }
  for (int p=0 ; p< k ;p ++) {
   /* Now the real array has elements in sorted manner including both 
        parts.*/
     A[ start++ ] = Arr[ p ] ;                          
  }
}


```

Time Complexity:
The list of size $N$ is divided into a max of $log(N)$ parts, and the merging of all sublists into a single list takes $O(N)$ time, the worst case run time of this algorithm is $O(Nlog(N))$

Question: Can we design an algorithm that is better than $O(Nlog(N))$??
