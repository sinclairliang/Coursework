### Basic Concepts on Tree ###

BST Properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
- There must be no duplicate nodes.

Some of the basic operations in `Tree` data structure:

`Insert()`: Inserts a new element in the tree

`Delete()`: Deletes an element in the tree

`Find()`: Returns the node that contains such value

`Min()`: Returns the node with minimum value

`Max()`: Returns the node with maximum value


### In this class we will mostly focus on Binary Search Tree, the tree that everything on the left is less that everything on the left ###
