### Binary Search ###

Compared to Linear Search, Binary Search only takes $lg(n)$ time to find an element, given the array is sorted.


### Trees ###

Tree is very powerful and one of the most sophisticated data structures in representing data. With the knowledge of tree, we shall be able to enter Graph when we are in upper division classes in computer science.

`basic structure`

in Java 
```java
class TreeNode
{
    int key;
    TreeNode left, right;

    public TreeNode(int item)
    {
        key = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```
in C

```c

struct node  
{ 
  int data; 
  struct node *left; 
  struct node *right; 
};
```
