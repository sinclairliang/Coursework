### Collisions in Hashtable ###

This is our hash table. But what if there is more than one item get the same hash code, aka, collisions. How do we resolve this problem?

On Tuesday we talk about the method of `chaining`, which means we can just chain all the elements with the same hash code into a linkedlist so that we dont have to worry about multiple items in one slot. 

However, what is the worst scenario in this practice? Think about all the elements get to the same slot, really what we have is just a linkedlist instead of a hashtable. We cannot really achieve $O(n)$ time in `insert`, `find` and `delete` operations. 

For `chaining` method, you can see my notes on Tuesday's lecture. We now talk about another method of collision resolution: `Open Addressing`

Here is a comparison between two methods.

|\/|Seperate Chaining|Open Addressing|
|---|---|---|
||Chaining is Simpler to implement.|Open Addressing requires more computation|
||In chaining, Hash table never fills up, we can always add more elements to chain.|In open addressing, table may become full.|
||Chaining is Less sensitive to the hash function or load factors.|Open addressing requires extra care for to avoid clustering and load factor.|
||Chaining is mostly used when it is unknown how many and how frequently keys may be inserted or deleted.|Open addressing is used when the frequency and number of keys is known.|
||Wastage of Space (Some Parts of hash table in chaining are never used).|In Open addressing, a slot can be used even if an input doesnâ€™t map to it.|
||Chaining uses extra space for links.|No links in Open addressing|


There are more ways to handle collisions: for further study, I recommend:
